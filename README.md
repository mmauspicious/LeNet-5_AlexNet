**AI Course First Project â€“ Multiclass Image Classification**

**Project Description:**

This project tackles a multiclass classification challenge using image data. Your task is to obtain images from Kaggle, ensuring that each class contains no more than 60 images, with a minimum of three distinct classes. The images may represent various fields such as medical, dental, engineering, or others.

Instructions:

    Data Collection [1]:
     - Visit Kaggle and download image datasets.
     - Ensure that you select images for at least three different classes, with no class exceeding 60 images.

    Model Training and Evaluation:
     - Employ transfer learning by training models using the LeNet-5 and AlexNet architectures.
     - Evaluate and compare the performance of these models using metrics such as accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

The goal of this project is to analyze and compare the performance of two different transfer learning models on a multiclass image classification problem.
